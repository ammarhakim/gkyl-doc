Moments App: Multifluid-moment-Maxwell model
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Summary of model equations
--------------------------

The ``Moment`` app solves high-moment multifluid equations on a Cartesian grid, coupled to Maxwell's equations through the Lorentz force.

* Each fluid could be either five-moment, where the plasma pressure is assumed to a scalar (see [Hakim+2006]_), or ten-moment, where the full anisotropic and nongyrotropic plasma pressure tensors (see [Hakim2008]_) are evolved.

* The hyperbolic system is solved in converative forms of :ref:`the five-moment (Euler) equations<devEigenSysEuler>`, and/or :ref:`the ten-moment equations<devEigenSys10M>`, and :ref:`the perfectly hyperbolic Maxwell's equations<devEigenSysMaxwell>`.

* The sources that couples the plasma species momenta and electromagnetic fields are described :ref:`here<devFluidSrc>` and more comprehensively in [Wang+2020]_.


This App solves the hyperbolic and source parts parts of the coupled system separately and apply high accuracy schemes on both.

* Ignoring sources, the homogeneous equations of the fluid moments and electromagneic fields are solved separately using a high-resolution wave-propagation finite-volume method described in [Hakim+2006]_. The main time-step size constraint comes from the speed of light.

* The sources are evolved using a locally implicit, time-centered solver to step over the constraining scales like the Debye length and plasma frequency, etc. See :ref:`devFluidSrc` or [Wang+2020]_ for more details.

* Additonial sources can be added if needed, for example, for the ten-moment model, we may apply the closure to relax the pressure tensor towards a scalar pressure (see [Wang+2015]_).

* We then apply an Strang-type operator-splitting sequence to combine the hyperbolic and source parts to achive second-order accuracy in time:

  .. math:: \exp\left(\mathcal{L}_{S}\Delta t/2\right)\exp\left(\mathcal{L}_{H}\Delta t\right)\exp\left(\mathcal{L}_{S}\Delta t/2\right).

  Here, we represent the homogeneous update schematically as the operator :math:`\exp\left(\mathcal{L}_{H}\Delta t\right)` and the source update as :math:`\exp\left(\mathcal{L}_{S}\Delta t\right)`.

     -
   * - ``upper``
     - CDIM length table with upper-right configuration space coordinates
     -
   * - ``cells``
     - CDIM length table with number of configuration space cells
     -
   * - ``cfl``
     - CFL number to use. **This parameter should be avoided and
       ``cflFrac`` used instead.**
     - Determined from ``cflFrac``
   * - ``cflFrac``
     - Fraction (usually 1.0) to multiply CFL determined time-step. 
     - Determined from ``timeStepper``
   * - ``maximumDt``
     - Hard limit of time step size.
     - ``tEnd-tStart``
   * - ``timeStepper``
     - The multifluid-Maxwell model currently only supports the dimensional-
       splitting finite-volume method, i.e., ``"fvDimSplit"``.
     - ``"fvDimSplit"``
   * - ``decompCuts``
     - CDIM length table with number of processors to use in each
       configuration space direction.
     - ``{ }``
   * - ``useShared``
     - Set to ``true`` to use shared memory.
     - ``false``
   * - ``periodicDirs``
     - Periodic directions. Note: X is 1, Y is 2 and Z is 3. E.g., ``{2}`` sets
       the Y direction to be periodic.
     - ``{ }``

.. note::

   - In general, you should not specify ``cfl`` or ``cflFrac``,
     unless either doing tests or explicitly controlling the
     time-step. The app will determine the time-step automatically.
   - When ``useShared=true`` the ``decompCuts`` must specify the
     *number of nodes* and not number of processors. That is, the total
     number of processors will be determined from ``decompCuts`` and
     the number of threads per node.

     
Species parameters

       guarantee positivity but is more diffusive.

   * - ``equationInv``
     - Backup equation that guarantees positivity in case it is violated when
       the default ```equation``` is used. Examples are:

App output
----------

The app will write snapshots of moments for each species and the EM
fields at specified time intervals. Diagnostics like integrated fluid
moments and field energy are recorded for each time-step and written
in one file for each species/field object.

The output format is `ADIOS BP
<https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/center-projects/adios/>`_ files. Say your
input file is called "5m.lua" and your species are called "elc"
and "ion". Then, over specified time invertals the app will write out
the following files:

- ``5m_elc_N.bp``
- ``5m_ion_N.bp``
- ``5m_field_N.bp``

Where ``N`` is the frame number (frame 0 is the initial
conditions). Note that if a species or the field is not evolved, then
only initial conditions will be written unless the ``forceWrite`` option
is set to ``true``.

In addition, integrated moments for each species are
written:

- ``vlasov_elc_intMom_N.bp``

For the field, the electromagnetic energy components :math:`E_x^2`,
:math:`E_y^2`, :math:`E_z^2`, :math:`B_x^2`, :math:`B_y^2`, and
:math:`B_z^2` (integrated over configuration space) are stored in the
file:

- ``vlasov_fieldEnergy_N.bp``

These can be plotted using postgkyl in the usual way.
