growth
======

Measure the growth rate in the time trace of a quantity, assuming that
it is a squared quantity (e.g. :math:`\phi^2`, :math:`|\mathbf{E}|^2`).
If one applies this to a non-squared quantity then the growth-rate
would be off by a factor of two.

The command works by fitting :math:`A e^(2\gamma t)` to the data and
returning :math:`\gamma`.

   $ pgkyl growth --help
   Usage: pgkyl growth [OPTIONS]

   Attempts to compute growth rate (i.e. fit e^(2x)) from DynVector data,
   typically an integrated quantity like electric or magnetic field energy.
   
   Options:
     -u, --use TEXT                Specify a 'tag' to apply to (default all
                                   tags).
   
     -g, --guess <FLOAT FLOAT>...  Specify initial guess
     -p, --plot                    Plot the data and fit
     --minn INTEGER                Set minimal number of points to fit
     --maxn INTEGER                Set maximal number of points to fit
     -i, --instantaneous           Plot instantaneous growth rate vs time
     -h, --help                    Show this message and exit.

The :doc:`two tream instability simulation<../input/two-stream>` produces
a field energy time trace that can be plotted with 

.. code-block:: bash

  pgkyl two-stream_fieldEnergy.bp sel -c0 pl --logy

.. figure:: ../fig/growth/two-stream_fieldEnergy.png
  :align: center

We have selected the :math:`E_x` component because all other field
components are essentially zero. We can then measure the growth rate in the
field energy with the following command

.. code-block:: bash

  pgkyl two-stream_fieldEnergy.bp sel -c0 growth

Such command produces the output below

.. code-block:: bash

  fitGrowth: fitting region 100 -> 7916
  gamma = +3.79836e-01 (current +5.814e-02 R^2=7.407e-01)    99.99% done [========= ]
  gamma = +3.79836e-01

This output indicates that it made the measurement taking into account all
the data between the 100th and the 7916th point (if you examine the file
two-stram_fieldEnergy.bp you'd find that it has 7916 data points), and
arrived at the growth rate :math:`\gamma=0.379836`, the the :math:`R^2` of
the fit being 0.7407.

The ``growth`` command also allows for specifying a window in which to
perform the measurement via the ``--minn`` and ``--maxn`` flags. We could
then limit the window between the 2000th and the 6000th point with

.. code-block:: bash

  pgkyl two-stream_fieldEnergy.bp sel -c0 growth --minn 2000 --maxn 6000

and the output would be

.. code-block:: bash

  fitGrowth: fitting region 2000 -> 6000
  gamma = +3.79836e-01 (current +4.322e-01 R^2=9.998e-01)    99.98% done [========= ]
  gamma = +3.79836e-01

giving the same result obtained above.

There is also an option for specifying a guess to :math:`A` and
:math:`\gamma` in the fit, via the `-g` flag:

.. code-block:: bash

  pgkyl two-stream_fieldEnergy.bp sel -c0 growth --minn 2000 --maxn 6000 -g 1. 0.36

.. code-block:: bash

  fitGrowth: fitting region 2000 -> 6000
  gamma = +3.79836e-01 (current +4.322e-01 R^2=9.998e-01)    99.98% done [========= ]
  gamma = +3.79836e-01
