Postgkyl key concepts
+++++++++++++++++++++

There are a few basic concepts of using ``pgkyl`` in a command
line. Together, they allow to quickly and easily create quite complex
diagnostics, which would otherwise require writing custom
postpocessing scripts.

Note that there are often multiple ways to achieve the same
thing. Sometimes, they are analogous, othertimes, one is
superior. This page makes an attempt to explain these key concepts to
allow user to choose the best solution for each situation.

Dataset
-------
.. _pg_keyconcepts_dataset:

Each data file which is :ref:`loaded <pg_loading>` creates a
dataset. Additionally, some commands can create new datasets during the
flow.

When files are loaded using wildcard characters, each match creates
its own dataset. Therefore, assuming there are two files, ``file1.bp``
and ``file2.bp``, located in the current directory, the two following
commands will have the same result; both will create two datasets:

.. code-block:: bash

   pgkyl file1.bp file2.bp
   pgkyl file?.bp

The :ref:`pg_cmd_info` command with the ``-c`` flag is useful to list
all available datasets.

Command chaining
----------------
.. _pg_keyconcepts_chaining:

Commands are evaluated from left to right. Each command, by default
applies to *everything* to the left of it. For example, this command
chain combines :ref:`loading <pg_loading>` data files and
:ref:`pg_cmd_interpolate` command:

.. code-block:: bash

   pgkyl file1.bp interpolate file2.bp

``file1.bp`` is loaded first, its DG expansion coefficients
are then interpolated on a finer uniform mesh, and, finally,
``file2.bp`` is loaded. :ref:`pg_cmd_interpolate` will *not* be
applied on ``file2.bp``. This particular example can be used, for
example, to simultaneously work with finite-element and finite-volume
data.

Commands that should not be applied on all the datasets can be further
controlled using :ref:`tags <pg_pg_keyconcepts_tags>` and by
designating some datasets as :ref:`inactive
<pg_keyconcepts_active>`. **Note that there are some commands, e.g.,**
:ref:`pg_cmd_collect`, **which switch their inputs to inactive
themselves.**

It is worth noting that there is no limit on how many commands can be
chained. See, for example, the :ref:`particle balance
<qs_gk1_balance>` section the the gyrokinetic :ref:`quickstart page
<qs_gk1>`.

Tags
----
.. _pg_keyconcepts_tags:

During :ref:`loading <pg_loading>`, optional flag, ``--tag`` or
``-t``, can be used to assign a tag to the dataset(s).

The default behavior of most of the commands is agnostic to the
tags. For example, the following two commands will lead to the same
result:

.. code-block:: bash

   pgkyl file1.bp file2.bp plot
   pgkyl file1.bp -t 'f1' file2.bp -t 'f2' plot

However, most of the commands can take the ``--use`` or ``-u`` flag to
limit them only to the datasets with the specified tag. Similar to
the example above, this can be useful when working with different
types of data:

.. code-block:: bash

   pgkyl file1.bp -t 'f1' file2.bp -t 'f2' interpolate -u f1 plot

Here, :ref:`pg_cmd_interpolate` will be used only on the ``file1.bp``
even though it follows loading both of the files. The ``plot`` command
will then apply to both the datasets.

Note that multiple comma-separated tags can be used:

.. code-block:: bash

   pgkyl file1.bp -t 'f1' file2.bp -t 'f2' file3.bp -t 'f3' interpolate -u f1,f2 plot

Additionally, there are some commands like :ref:`pg_cmd_collect` or
:ref:`pg_cmd_animate` are by default tag-aware and separate datasets
with different tags from each other.

When no tag is specified, the ``default`` tag is assigned.

.. warning::
   When using tags together with wildcard characters, it is important
   to use quotes, e.g.:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pgkyl 'file?.bp' -t name

   Without the quotes, the string is replaced with all the matches,
   ``pgkyl`` treats them as separate :ref:`load <pg_loading>`
   commands, and the specified tag is applied only to the last match.


Active and inactive datasets
----------------------------
.. _pg_keyconcepts_active:

In addition to specifying :ref:`tags <pg_keyconcepts_tags>`, the flow
of a ``pgkyl`` command chain can be controlled by :ref:`activating
<pg_cmd_activate>` and :ref:`deactivating <pg_cmd_deactivate>`
datasets. By default, all loaded datasets are active. This can be
changed with the pair of :ref:`pg_cmd_activate` and
:ref:`pg_cmd_deactivate` commands. In addition, commands that create a
new dataset, e.g., :ref:`pg_cmd_collect`, leave only the output
active. The motivation behind this is that these commands change the
nature of data and user would typically want to keep working only with
the result. The aforementioned :ref:`pg_cmd_collect` turns
N-dimensional data to (N+1)-dimensional data. With the inputs
inactive, commands can be easily chained, e.g.,

.. code-block:: bash

   pgkyl 'file*.bp' collect plot


:ref:`pg_cmd_activate` can either take in indices, tags, or
both. When no inputs are specified, everything is activated. The two
following commands provide yet another way to to achieve the same
result as in the tag example above:

.. code-block:: bash

   pgkyl file1.bp -t f1 file2.bp -t f2 activate -t f1 interpolate activate plot
   pgkyl file1.bp file2.bp activate -i 0 interpolate activate plot

In both cases only the ``file1.bp`` is active and, therefore, the
:ref:`pg_cmd_interpolate` command is applied only on the first
file. The second activate then reactivates the second file again so
the :ref:`pg_cmd_plot` command is going to plot both.

The :ref:`pg_cmd_info` command can be useful when working with
multiple active/inactive datasets. Its ``--compact`` option shows only
identifiers for each dataset, thus removes some clatter, and
``--allsets`` adds even the currently inactive datasets.


Overwriting vs. new dataset
---------------------------
.. _pg_keyconcepts_overwrite:

There are two basic ways commandsinteract with inputs. The first type
modifies its inputs and pushes data down the chain. A typical example
is the :ref:`pg_cmd_interpolate` command, which takes expansion
coefficients of DG finite-element data and interpolates them on a
finer uniform mesh, essentially creating finite-volume like data.

.. code-block:: bash

   pgkyl file1.bp interpolate plot

In this case the original information is lost after the
:ref:`pg_cmd_interpolate` command (lost within this command chain,
nothing happens to the data file itself).

The other type does not overwrite its inputs but rather creates a new
dataset. As a rule of thumb, these are commands that take (or can
take) multiple inputs and/or change the nature of data. Note that
these commands often make the result the only active dataset to
simplify the flow. A typical example is the :ref:`pg_cmd_ev` command:

.. code-block:: bash

   pgkyl file1.bp file2.bp ev 'f[0] f[1] -' plot

As a result of this chain, there will be three datasets; however, only
the result of :ref:`pg_cmd_ev` will be active, so the
:ref:`pg_cmd_plot` command will create just one figure.

There are instances when user does *not* want to overwrite the
inputs. For example, when we want to use :ref:`pg_cmd_select` to
create multiple slices of data. For this purpose, the commands that
would normally overwrite data have the optional ``--tag`` or ``-t`` flag
which instead creates a new dataset with specified tag. Note that in
this case, the resulting dataset will **not** be the only one active.

.. code-block:: bash

   pgkyl file1.bp -t input select -u input --z0 -1. -t planes \
   select -u input --z0 1. -t planes plot -u planes
