**Gkeyll can be used freely for research at universities, national
laboratories and other non-profit institutions.**

We follow a *open-source but closed development model*.  Even though
read access to the code is available to everyone, write access to the
source-code repository is restricted to those who need to modify the
code. In practice, this means researchers at PPPL and our partner
institutions. In particular, this means that for write access you
either need to have jointly funded projects or jointly supervised
graduate students with Princeton University/PPPL.

Caveat Emptor
-------------

Parts of Gkeyll have been funded by the United States Department of
Energy (DOE). The DOE *requires* that users outside of PPPL sign a
license agreement with PPPL for *all codes* developed here with DOE
funds.

You, Dear User, are responsible for completing the needed paperwork
(see `here
<https://theory.pppl.gov/research/TheoryCodeLicenseReleaseForm.pdf>`_. Use
"Ammar Hakim" for the "PPPL Researcher's Names" field.). Unpleasant
consequences may result if this paperwork is not completed.
