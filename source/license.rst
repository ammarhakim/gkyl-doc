**Gkeyll can be used freely for research at universities, national
laboratories and other institutions.**

We follow a *open-source but closed development model*.  Even though
read access to the code is available to everyone, write access to the
source-code repository is restricted to those who need to modify the
code. In practice, this means researchers at PPPL and our partner
institutions. In particular, this means that for write access you
either need to have jointly funded projects or jointly supervised
graduate students with Princeton University/PPPL.

In general, we allow users to "fork" the code to make their own
modifications. However, we would appreciate if you would work with us
to merge your features back into the main-line (if those features are
useful to the larger Gkeyll team).
