We follow a *open-source but closed development model*. Gkyl can be
used freely for *research at universities, national laboratories and
other non-profit institutions*. Release zip-balls will be
provided. Access to the source-code repository is restricted to those
who need to modify the code. In practice, this means researchers at
PPPL and our partner institutions. That is, those who have jointly
funded projects with us.
