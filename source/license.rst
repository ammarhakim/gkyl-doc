We follow a *open-source but closed development model*.  Even though
read access to the code is available to everyone, write access to the
source-code repository is restricted to those who need to modify the
code. In practice, this means researchers at PPPL and our partner
institutions. In particular, this means you either need to have
jointly funded projects or jointly supervised graduate students with
Princeton University/PPPL.
