Quickstart
++++++++++

Once you have a working installation of Gkeyll, you can get to know the code and learn
how to use it by following these quickstart examples.

For additional examples one can browse the regression tests folder in the gkyl code or
repository (``gkyl/Regression/``). We also began compiling input files for simulations
reported by publications in `this repository <https://github.com/ammarhakim/gkyl-paper-inp>`_.
Lastly, more examples and in depth information about the gkyl Apps can be found in the
:ref:`gkyl Reference <gkyl_apps>`.
