Documentation of Postgkyl Commands
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Postgkyl uses a command pipeline approach: commands can be chained,
the output of one command being fed to the next command in the chain.

Postgkyl has a large number of commands, including commands to slice
data, normalize or scale it, integrate along specified axis, compute
derivatives (curl, div, grad), etc. Nearly arbitrary command
combinations are allowed, making the system extremely powerful.
