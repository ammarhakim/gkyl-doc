Hold
++++

The hold command is used before the plot command as a means of
specifying if plots are made on the same plot window, or
different. The default plot behavior is that each plot is shown in a
different window.

The command takes the following options:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30, 60, 10
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option

   * - --off
