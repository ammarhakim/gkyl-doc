   "I love pgkyl! However, Petr, the next feature I want is ..."
   -- Ammar Hakim

Below is the living reference to the Postgkyl tool for post-processing
:ref:`gkyl <gkyl_main>` simulation data. The main aspiration of
Postgkyl is to create a postprocessing suit which would:

1. Make simple tasks very easy
2. Make complex tasks possible

The documentation is split into three sections. The first section
introduces the key concepts of using Postgkyl and goes into details of
loading data. Particularly the former one is a strongly recommended
reading for new users. The second part provides many examples of using
Postgkyl, which aim to supplement the examples already presented in
the :ref:`qs_main` chapter. Finally, the last part consists of
detailed documentation for each individual available command.
