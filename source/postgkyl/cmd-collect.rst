Collect
+++++++

The collect command is used to "collect" or combine data from a bunch
of datasets into a single, larger dataset. For example, given a
sequence of 10 1D 100 cell datasets, one can collect them into a
single :math:`10\times 100` dataset using the collect command.

This command takes no options.
