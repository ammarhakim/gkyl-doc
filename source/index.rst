:hero: A multi-scale, multi-physics simulation framework

The :math:`\texttt{Gkeyll}` Simulation Framework
================================================

:math:`\texttt{Gkeyll}` (`GitHub Repository <https://github.com/ammarhakim/gkeyll>`_) is
a multi-scale, multi-physics simulation framework, developed for a variety of
applications in plasma physics, space physics, general relativity, and high-energy
astrophysics. The core of :math:`\texttt{Gkeyll}` is written in C, featuring a
lightweight, modular design and minimal external dependencies, plus an additional Lua
scripting layer (for specifying simulation input parameters) provided via the `Lua-C API
<https://www.lua.org/pil/24.html>`_.

:math:`\texttt{Gkeyll}`'s clean and modular design ensures that the entire code can be
built hierarchically, with the following layers:

* :math:`\texttt{core}`
    Critical software infrastructure that is common to all parts of the
    :math:`\texttt{Gkeyll}` framework, including grid-generation, parallelism, file
    input/output, Lua tools, and certain fundamental array and discontinuous Galerkin
    operations.

* :math:`\texttt{moments}`
    :math:`\texttt{Gkeyll}`'s finite-volume solvers for various systems of hyperbolic
    PDEs, including (relativistic) multi-fluid equations, perfectly hyperbolic Maxwell
    equations, and Einstein field equations. Also includes infrastructure for
    integrating ODEs, solving Poisson equations, and specifying curved spacetime
    geometries (e.g. black holes and neutron stars) for general relativistic
    simulations. [Wang2020]_ [Gorard2024]_

* :math:`\texttt{vlasov}`
    :math:`\texttt{Gkeyll}`'s modal discontinuous Galerkin solvers for the
    (relativistic) Vlasov-Maxwell and Vlasov-Poisson equation systems, supporting
    continuum kinetics simulations in any number of configuration space and velocity
    space dimensions, from 1x1v (2D phase space) to full 3x3v (6D phase space). Also
    includes modal discontinuous Galerkin solvers for evolving various Hamiltonian
    systems, as specified via their canonical Poisson bracket structure. [Juno2018]_
    [Juno2020]_

* :math:`\texttt{gyrokinetic}`
    :math:`\texttt{Gkeyll}`'s modal discontinuous Galerkin solvers for the full
    :math:`f` gyrokinetic equation in the long-wavelength limit (coupled to the
    gyrokinetic Poisson equation), supporting continuum electrostatic gyrokinetics in
    any number of configuration space dimensions, from 1x2v (3D phase space) to
    full 3x2v (5D phase space). Also includes infrastructure for specifying tokamak and
    mirror geometries for nuclear fusion applications. [Mandell2020]_ [Mandell2021]_

* :math:`\texttt{pkpm}`
    :math:`\texttt{Gkeyll}`'s modal discontinuous Galerkin solvers for the
    parallel-kinetic-perpendicular-moment equations, supporting simulation of weakly
    collisional, magnetized plasmas in any number of configuration space dimensions,
    from 1x1v (2D phase space) to 3x1v (4D phase space). [Juno2025]_

Technology Stack
----------------

:math:`\texttt{Gkeyll}` (`GitHub Repository <https://github.com/ammarhakim/gkeyll>`_) is
written in straight C, with support for multi-CPU parallelism via MPI, (NVIDIA) GPU
acceleration via CUDA, and multi-GPU parallelism via NCCL. The only strictly *required*
dependencies for installing :math:`\texttt{Gkeyll}` are:

* ``OpenBLAS`` (including both ``BLAS`` and ``LAPACK``) for numerical linear algebra
  routines.

* ``SuperLU`` for solving sparse linear systems.

with the additional *optional* dependencies:

* ``LuaJIT`` (optional, but *strongly* recommended) for enabling
  :math:`\texttt{Gkeyll}`'s Lua scripting layer.

* ``cuDSS`` for solving sparse linear systems on GPUs (only required for GPU builds).

* ``OpenMPI`` for multi-CPU and multi-GPU parallelism (only required for parallel
  builds).

* ``ADAS`` for atomic data (only required for certain gyrokinetic simulations).

In addition to hand-written C code, :math:`\texttt{Gkeyll}` also consists of a large
amount of automatically-generated C code (especially for its modal discontinuous Galerkin
routines) that have been produced using the ``Maxima`` computer algebra system. Various
core aspects of :math:`\texttt{Gkeyll}`'s algorithmic infrastructure have also been
formally verified, with symbolic correctness proofs produced using a bespoke automated
theorem-proving system developed in ``Racket``. Both the ``Maxima`` computer algebra
code and the ``Racket`` automated theorem-proving code are packaged as part of the
:math:`\texttt{gkylcas}` project, `whose GitHub repository can be found here
<https://github.com/ammarhakim/gkylcas>`_. Finally, the :math:`\texttt{postgkyl}`
visualization and post-processing framework is developed in Python, based on
``matplotlib``, and `its GitHub repository can be found here
<https://github.com/ammarhakim/postgkyl>`_.
