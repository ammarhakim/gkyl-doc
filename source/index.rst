Gkeyll v2.0 (pronounced as in the book `"The Strange Case of
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"
<https://www.gutenberg.org/files/43/43-h/43-h.htm>`_) is a
computational plasma physics code mostly written in C and `LuaJIT
<http://luajit.org>`_. Gkeyll contains solvers for gyrokinetic
equations, Vlasov-Maxwell equations, and multi-fluid equations.

The Gkeyll package contains two major parts: the :ref:`gkyl <gkyl_main>`
simulation framework and the the :ref:`postgkyl <pg_main>` post-processing
package. Here you will find documentation for the full Gkeyll package.

Gkeyll is developed at multiple institutions, with the present
leadership residing at Princeton University's Department of
Astrophysical Sciences and the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory
(PPPL), a Department of Energy (DOE) national lab, managed by
Princeton University. Other major partners are Virginia Tech, MIT,
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), University of Maryland,
Indiana University, and Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR).

As of 2022, the active funding for the project comes from:

- National Science Foundation's `CSSI program
  <https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2209471&HistoricalAwards=false>`_
- DOE's SciDAC program
- ARPA-E BETHE Theory and Simulation Grant to Virginia Tech and PPPL
- Other NSF individual-PI awards to Princeton University
- PPPL LDRD program

Past funding has come from the Airforce Office of Scientific Research
and NASA.

The CEO and Algorithm Alchemist of the project is `Ammar Hakim
