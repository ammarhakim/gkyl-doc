The  Gkyl Code: Documentation Home
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is the documentation home for the Gkyl code. The name is
pronounced as in the book "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde". Gkyl is written in a combination of LuaJIT and C++. Most of
the top-level code is written in LuaJIT, while time-critical parts are
written in C++. Gkyl is developed at `Princeton Plasma Physics
Laboratory (PPPL) <http://www.pppl.gov>`_. For a full list of
contributors see :doc:`Authors <authors>` list.
